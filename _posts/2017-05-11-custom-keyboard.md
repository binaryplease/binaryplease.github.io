# Intro

I have been using mechanical keyboards for a while now and frankly, I never want to go back. After reading about custom keyboard layouts, alternative arrangement of keys and open-source keyboard firmwares, I decided to give it a try. I was looking for something minimalistic, portable and usefull. Also it had to be something with an open-source firmware I could modify to my needs.

I discovered the the keyboards at https://olkb.com/ and others which matched what I was looking for, but they where sold out at that moment. Other options where too expensive or just "not right" (I might have been picky). Long story short: I decided to build my own.

Where is the fun in just buying one? Also, how hard can it be?
