Here are some write-ups about projects of mine. I like to break things, to repair them, to modify them and to create new ones.

If you find something interesting or want to add something you are free to leave a comment or message me at <a href="mailto:pablo1@mailbox" itemprop="email"> pablo1@mailbox.org </a>

You can find my public GPG key here: [GPG Key](pub_key.asc)


This blog is build using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout)
theme on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
